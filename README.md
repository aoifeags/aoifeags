- 👋 Hi, I’m Aoife. I'm a fairly new developer, currently learning Java, with a background in Python and more functional styles.

- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack development and haven't chosen yet what direction I'll go in with programming.

- 🌱 I’m currently on the Bright Network Technology Academy 
   (that's a training program which teaches primarily Full Stack Java development + frameworks (SpringBoot and React) as well as some SQL.) 
   
- 💞️ I’m interested to network with other students of OOP as well as established professionals to find out more about what they do!
 If you are hiring junior software devs in Fintech, Digital Change and Transformation or another exciting area, and you think I may have the kind of background you're looking for, please reach out to me!

- 📫 You can message me on LinkedIn where I'm https://www.linkedin.com/in/aoife-sandy-boyle-360165196
