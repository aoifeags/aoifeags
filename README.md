- 👋 Hi, I’m Aoife. I'm a fairly new developer. I have a background in Python and more functional programming from self-learning, and have just completed a bootcamp in Java, Javascript, HTML & CSS. Currently, I'm transitioning to a Scala-based environment to support a major project within a global IT services company, so soon I'll be listing Scala as another language I use regularly. 

- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack development and haven't chosen yet what direction I'll go in, but my current project is predominantly back-end for the moment. I have previous professional experience (non-development) in the Finance industry, working mainly with wholesale and corporate banks in a recruitment capacity, although I've also had clients from investment banking, PE, hedge funds, private credit, and a variety of other firms on the periphery of the financial services world. 

- 🌱 In April 2022, I graduated from the Bright Network Technology Academy!
   (that's a training program which teaches primarily Full Stack Java development + frameworks (SpringBoot and React) as well as some SQL. You can learn more about it here: https://www.brightnetwork.co.uk/graduate-employer-company/bright-network-technology-academy/) 
   
- 💞️ I’m interested in networking with other students of OOP and new devs like me, as well as established professionals to find out more about what they do! 

- If you are hiring for junior software devs in Fintech, Digital Change and Transformation or another exciting area, and you think I may have the kind of background you're looking for, please reach out to me! 

- 📫 You can message me on LinkedIn where I'm https://www.linkedin.com/in/aoife-sandy-boyle-360165196
