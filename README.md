- 👋 Hi, I’m Aoife. I'm a fairly new developer, currently learning Java, with a background in Python and more functional styles.

- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack development and haven't chosen yet what direction I'll go in with programming.

- 🌱 I’m currently on the Bright Network Technology Academy 
   (that's a training program which teaches primarily Full Stack Java development + frameworks (SpringBoot and React) as well as some SQL.) 
   
- 💞️ I’m interested to network with other students of OOP as well as established professionals to find out more about what they do!

-- If you are hiring junior software devs in Fintech, Digital Change and Transformation, or for another exciting area, please reach out to me!

- 📫 You can message me on LinkedIn where I'm https://www.linkedin.com/in/Aoife Sandy Boyle.
